I completed a science fair project about measuring growth and success rates of coral starters on different substrates. Check out the ongoing project page <https://www.raisingcoral.org/>. This was actually my first exposure to R as I used it to analyze my data and make figures for my poster. I was mostly just following the direction of the project mentors but still got to interact with the language.\n\nI moved to Honolulu, HI to pursue a bachelor's of science in marine biology at UH Manoa but later chose to broaden my studies to include terrestrial life as well.\n\nI began volunteer work in many different realms of science: native ecosystem restoration, horticulture/agriculture, museum collection management, and lab work involving sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a brief stint in biochemistry, toad tongue muscle properties, and microhylid frog phylogenetics (the latter being most prevalent).

    "text": "I am originally from Boulder, CO where in high school I first became interested in pursuing biology. I completed a science fair project about measuring growth and success rates of coral starters on different substrates. Check out the ongoing project page https://www.raisingcoral.org/. This was actually my first exposure to R as I used it to analyze my data and make figures for my poster. I was mostly just following the direction of the project mentors but still got to interact with the language.\nI moved to Honolulu, HI to pursue a bachelor’s of science in marine biology at UH Manoa but later chose to broaden my studies to include terrestrial life as well.\nI began volunteer work in many different realms of science: native ecosystem restoration, horticulture/agriculture, museum collection management, and lab work involving sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a brief stint in biochemistry, toad tongue muscle properties, and microhylid frog phylogenetics (the latter being most prevalent). Check it out https://butlerlab.org/research/asterophryinae-frogs/!\n\nSince completing my BS, I have been working as teaching assistant for two different biology undergrad courses and working on writing up my first publication!"
